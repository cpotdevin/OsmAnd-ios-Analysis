            <h1>Wire App Analysis・Performance</h1>
            <p>To evaluate the performance of both Android and iOS Wire Apps we have defined a couple of scenarios that are likely to have performance problems. During these scenarios we will profile the application using its respective IDE to analyze its performance and identify possible problems. If a problem is identified during the scenarios we will attempt to improve the code in order to mitigate the performance problem. On the other hand if no problem is encountered we will dive into the codebase in an effort to identify the good design practices implemented in the App.</p>

                            <p>This is the screen we will be analyzing; looks pretty right? Let's take a look at it through Android Studio's profiler to see if we find any issues.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="step scrolly1" data-step="1" img-src="/resources/images/android-performance/idle-main-screen/fig01.jpg">
                            <p>Everything looks pretty normal: CPU usage is low, memory usage is constant, there are update requests every 30 seconds, and energy usage is low. Lets take a closer look at the memory usage.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="step scrolly1" data-step="2" img-src="/resources/images/android-performance/idle-main-screen/fig02.jpg">
                            <p>The dotted line shows the number of allocated objects in the app heap. It appears to be going up at a constant rate and doesn't go down even after a while.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="step scrolly1" data-step="3" img-src="/resources/images/android-performance/idle-main-screen/fig03.jpg">
                            <p>Taking a sample of 10 seconds we can see that from 2,966 allocated objects 2,961 were <code>Float</code> objects, but we're not doing anything! Where are these comming from?</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="step scrolly1" data-step="4" img-src="/resources/images/android-performance/idle-main-screen/fig04.jpg">
                            <p>A closer inspection of these <code>Float</code> objects shows that the code that instantiates them is not part of the app's codebase but part of the Andorid API. Nevertheless, these are instantiated by an <code>ObjectAnimator</code> class so we can start off by looking for instances of these in the code.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="step scrolly1" data-step="5" img-src="/resources/images/android-performance/idle-main-screen/fig05.jpg">
                            <p>Now that we know where to look we can go to the CPU profiler to locate the function calls that are instantiating these <code>Float</code> objects. Look at that! The green squares show us that the <code>InfiniteLoadingBarView</code> is the culprit. What is this class for you ask?</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="step scrolly1" data-step="6" img-src="/resources/images/android-performance/idle-main-screen/fig06.gif">
                            <p>This class is the one in charge of showing the red loading strip at the top of the screen when a message is received and is in the process of being downloaded. As you might have already guessed the problem is that the animation is never stopped even though the View's <code>Visible</code> value is set to <code>GONE</code>.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="step scrolly1" data-step="7" img-src="/resources/images/android-performance/idle-main-screen/fig07.jpg" figcaption="java/com/waz/zclient/views/InfiniteLoadingBarView.java">
                            <p>As we can see here the animation is only started when the view is added and stopped only when the view is destroyed, but this view isn't always visible!</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="step scrolly1" data-step="8" img-src="/resources/images/android-performance/idle-main-screen/fig08.jpg" figcaption="java/com/waz/zclient/views/InfiniteLoadingBarView.java">
                            <p>Solving this problem is easy, first we remove the calls to start the animation when the <code>View</code> is inflated or attached and then we override the <code>setVisibility()</code> method so that it also updates the state of the animator. This solution helps maintain the code contained and simple for external use, i.e. when you hide the loader there is no need to worry about stopping the animation. Now lets rerun a profiling session with this change implemented to see if our solution was effective.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="step scrolly1" data-step="9" img-src="/resources/images/android-performance/idle-main-screen/fig09.jpg">
                            <p>Now memory usage is much better, the number of allocated Objects is drastically smaller than before and there are no more <code>Float</code> objects being constantly instantiated.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="step scrolly1" data-step="10" img-src="/resources/images/android-performance/idle-main-screen/fig10.jpg">
                            <p>Finally, if we compare the profiling obtained with the patch to the one obtained at the beginning of the exercies we can see an improvement in all measurements except for network usage.</p>

                            <p>This is the process we will be analyzing: entering and exiting a conversation. Since we are engineers and engineers are lazy by nature lets make a shell script that uses <code>adb</code> and will perform this action repeatedly without having to tap the phone!</p>

                            <p>This script taps on two places on the phone in intervals of a second the number of times that is specified by the input parameter.

                            <div class="step scrolly3" data-step="0" img-src="/resources/images/iOS-performance/CPU.png">
                                <p>Unfortunately, iOS doesn't have a built in a tool to perform user interactions such as <code>adb</code>. For this reason, we are going to perform an scenario and will check the metrics of CPU, Memory, Disk and Network usage. For this purpouse <code>Xcode</code> was used and the built in <code>simulator</code>. The scenario is described below:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Send a text message.</li>
                                    <li>Send an image.</li>
                                    <li>Send a voice message.</li>
                                    <li>Send a location.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    First let's take a look to the CPU usage. It can be seen that the highest value was 160%. This is a weird number and may be related with the simulator and the capabilites of get higher physical processor speeds that the device trying to simulate. This peek was reach when the image was selected and shown in the app. The second peek was reached when de the image was send. In the <a href="#iosPerformanceVideo">video</a> the perfomance can be seen in detail.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="step scrolly3" data-step="1" img-src="/resources/images/iOS-performance/Memory.png">
                                <p>
                                    Now, let's see the Memory. It can be seen that the highest value was 241,3 MB. The Memory usage started to be high when the image was selected and shown in the app. Then, when the voice message was being recorded the highest value was reached. After sending the voice message the memory usage value droped to 180 MB. Finally, when the location was being sent, the memory value reached 217 MB, which also is a high value. In the <a href="#iosPerformanceVideo">video</a> the perfomance can be seen in detail.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="step scrolly3" data-step="2" img-src="/resources/images/iOS-performance/Disk.png">
                                <p>
                                    Now, let's see the Disk. It can be seen that the highest value was 21,9 MB in reading and 59,9 MB in writing. The highest values were reached when the voice message was being recorded. In the <a href="#iosPerformanceVideo">video</a> the perfomance can be seen in detail.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <p>
                                    Finally, let's see the Network. But... there's nothing to see. Unfortunately, for some reason <code>Xcode</code> didn't recognize any Network activity in all the process. This was made more than once and never happend nothing. From other device, attached to the same account, it was verified that the messages were being sent. This happens because all the processes in charge of sending and receiving the information are in the dependencies, more precisely in the <a href="https://github.com/wireapp/wire-ios-transport">wire-ios-transportation</a> dependence. This is also a <code>Xcode</code> project, but written mostly in Objective-C. In the <a href="#iosPerformanceVideo">video</a> the perfomance can be seen in detail.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Something to notice, it's that the <a href="/ux-ui/index.html#bug2">bug</a> reported in <a href="/ux-ui/index.html">UX-UI</a> section appers here again. Every time the user wants to send a photo the problem with the keyboard showing up appers again. But, in the second attempt, sending a location, this bug doesn't appear. In the <a href="#iosPerformanceVideo">video</a> this can be seen better.
                                </p>

                                <p>Wire uses the <code>DispatchQueue</code> to use the threads available in iOS. This is used to do all the fetch needed by the user. There is a fetch per every type of message available in the app (e.g. images, text, profile images). As seen in the image, the fetch is assigned to the <code>main thread</code> in the <code>GCD</code>. This is may cause a problem, because this thread has in charge the UI and may cause a ANR, specially with some complex fetch such as images. It would be a better practice to do it in a lower priority queue, like <code>.background</code>, and leave the main thread free to most important tasks. </p>

                                <p>Wire has a class for the Images to save it in the cache, as the image shows it. It can be seen that Wire uses the <code>NSCache</code> class, which is a mutable collection you use to temporarily store transient key-value pairs. In this case Wire uses again the threads available in the <code>GCD</code>, but this time it uses the <code>DispatchQueue</code> using the <code>.background </code> queue, leaving the main thread free. </p>

                                <p>Also, as shown in the image of <a href="#ios2">Threads</a> section, the cache is used to avoid the fetch of the image. But in the case that the fetch has to be done the image is stored in the cache. All this process is done with images and Profile Images, but apparently not done in other type of messages.</p>
