            <h1>Wire App Analysis・Eventual Connectivity</h1>
            <p>To test out how the Wire App performs under conditions which have a lack of connectivity we will proceed to carry out a set of actions with airplane mode turned on to make sure no connection to the internet is available. Also, for each action we will try to pinpoint the code that manages a lack of connectivity in each scenarios. The set of actions we will perform are the following:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Signin</li>
                <li>Open a conversation</li>
                <li>Send a message</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Sections</h2>

                <p>Lets take a look at how the Android app takes care of connectivity problems.</p>

                <section class="scrolly">
                    <article>
                        <div class="step scrolly1" data-step="0" img-src="/resources/images/android-connectivity/fig00.jpg" figcaption="manifests/AndroidManifest.xml">
                            <p>
                                First off, lets take a look at the Android manifest to determine what connectivity related permissions. Here we can see that the app requests permission to access <code>INTENET</code> and <code>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE</code>.
                                <br><br>
                                Next, lets take a look at the signup action without an internet connection.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div id="android1" class="step scrolly1" data-step="1" img-src="/resources/images/android-connectivity/fig01.jpg">
                            <p>As we can see here after trying to signup with a phone number the app shows a dialog prompting the user to check his/her internet connection. After a simple profiling to sample method calls we can find out how this is done.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="step scrolly1" data-step="2" img-src="/resources/images/android-connectivity/fig02.jpg" figcaption="java/com/waz/zclient/appentry/fragments/SignInFragment.scala">
                            <p>
                                Here we can see that a <code>onResponse()</code> method is defined to handle any error that occurs during the signin process and shows an error dialog to the user. Also, here we can see that they also create an <code>implicit</code> <code>ExecutionContext</code> that is later used when managing the <code>SignInMethod</code>. As we can see the definition of the <code>onResponse()</code> method allows the code to be more concise and manage all connection errors encountered when using any of the signin methods.
                                <br><br>
                                Now lets take a look at what happens when a user opens a conversation while he/she has no internet connection.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div id="android2" class="step scrolly1" data-step="3" img-src="/resources/images/android-connectivity/fig03.gif">
                            <p>
                                The app encounters no problems and the conversation opens normally with the previously known information while informing the user that there is no internet connection available. This is good for user experience, i.e. a user can see his past conversations while knowing he will not receive new messages. Also, the conversation loads older messages from memory if the user scrolls to the top of the conversation.
                                <br><br>
                                The important components here are the top yellow bar and the SQLite database used by the app to save and load messages.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="step scrolly1" data-step="4" img-src="/resources/images/android-connectivity/fig04.jpg" figcaption="java/com/waz/service/NetworkModeService.scala">
                            <p>To determine if there is an internet connection Wire sets up a BroadcastReceiver that is registered to receive updates on connectivity changes.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="step scrolly1" data-step="5" img-src="/resources/images/android-connectivity/fig05.jpg" figcaption="java/com/waz/service/NetworkModeService.scala">
                            <p>Then, the <code>ConnectivityFragment</code> subscribes to this signal and shows or hides the <code>ConnectivityIndicatorView</code> accordingly.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="step scrolly1" data-step="6" img-src="/resources/images/android-connectivity/fig06.jpg" figcaption="java/com/waz/zclient/messages/MessagePagedListController.scala">
                            <p>If we take a look at how the app loads conversations we can see that it passes the conversation data to the <code>MessagePagedListController</code> who extracts the conversations id and pases it on to the <code>MessagesStorageImpl</code> to get the messages.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="step scrolly1" data-step="7" img-src="/resources/images/android-connectivity/fig07.jpg" figcaption="java/com/waz/content/MessageStorage.scala">
                            <p>The <code>MessageStorageImpl</code> extends <code>CachedStorageImpl</code> and when asked for the messages calls its parents <code>getAll(ids)</code> method.<Message</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="step scrolly1" data-step="8" img-src="/resources/images/android-connectivity/fig08.jpg" figcaption="java/com/waz/utils/CachedStorageImpl.scala">
                            <p>
                                Finally, the <code>CachedStorageImpl</code> attempts to get as many messages from its cached storage as possible and then gets the remaining messages from the phones SQLite tables and stores those in the cached storage.
                                <br><br>
                                Next lets take a look at how the app manages a user sending a message when there is no internet connection.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div id="android3" class="step scrolly1" data-step="9" img-src="/resources/images/android-connectivity/fig09.gif">
                            <p>
                                As can be seen here Wire shows the sent message but includes a message bellow indicating that the message was not sent together with a button to retry to send the message. Also, Wire shows the top yellow bar indicating a lack of internet connection.
                                <br><br>
                                How exactly does Wire do this? Lets take a closer look at the codebase to better understand this.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="step scrolly1" data-step="10" img-src="/resources/images/android-connectivity/fig10.jpg" figcaption="java/com/waz/sync/handler/MessageSyncHandler.scala">
                            <p>This job is performed by the <code>MessageSyncHandler</code> who, tries to post the message and if he receives an error he procedes to tell the <code>MessagesService</code> that the message failed to send by calling its <code>messageDeliveryFailed()</code> method with the message info.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="step scrolly1" data-step="11" img-src="/resources/images/android-connectivity/fig11.jpg" figcaption="java/com/waz/services/messages/MessagesService.scala">
                            <p>In <code>MessagesServiceImpl</code> we can see that it simply updates the state of that message and then tells the <code>MessagesContentUpdater</code> to update the message data.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="step scrolly1" data-step="12" img-src="/resources/images/android-connectivity/fig12.jpg" figcaption="java/com/waz/utils/CachedStorageImpl.scala">

                <p>Lets take a look at how the iOS app takes care of connectivity problems.</p>
                <section class="scrolly">
                    <article>
                            <div class="step scrolly1" data-step="0" img-src="/resources/images/iOS-connectivity/EC-Introduction.png">
                                <p>
                                    Wire has a NetworkStatus folder where constantly verifies the internet connection. In the case that there is no internet connection available a banner is shown at the top of the screen. Also, when the user tries to send a message Wire has a label where tells the user that the messaging it’s trying to be sent. In iOS devices, after some time, Wire shows two possible actions to be done: Resend the message or delete it. In Android devices just the resend button it’s available and it shows it immediately. This is helpful to the user because it tells him that Wire tried to send it but it was not possible. Finally, when the bar is touched it appears a message telling the user a better description of the current network state. The decisions made by Wire follows the good practices of usability, because shows to the user that something it’s wrong with the connection but allows him to do other actions and doesn’t block all the app. All these messages and alerts are shown in the images:
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="step scrolly1" data-step="1" img-src="/resources/images/iOS-connectivity/EC-1.png">
                                <p>
                                    For this Wire has a View and a Controller, following the MVC of iOS, just avoiding the Model. In the first one Wire changes all the constraints and manages the Offline Bar if this has to be shown. The desition of what to do, which message to show and when is took by the Controller. Wire has all the code related to this in a folder to easily do find it and do changes.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="step scrolly1" data-step="2" img-src="/resources/images/iOS-connectivity/EC-2.png" figcaption="Sources/UserInterface/Components/NetworkStatus/NetworkStatusViewDelegate.swift">
                                <p>
                                    Wire establish 3 different types of connection (Or non-connections) as a state. The first one is online, which is the desire and normal type of connection. When this case is the current one the offline bar is hidden. When one of the other two types is the current one the offline bar appears and shows a message according to the type of non-connection. Wire manages the state in an enum in the <code>NetworkStatusView </code> class as shown below:
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="step scrolly1" data-step="3" img-src="/resources/images/iOS-connectivity/EC-3.png" figcaption="Sources/UserInterface/Conversation/Content/Content/Cells/Unity/MessageToolboxView.swift">
                                <p>
                                    The message can be resent and the red button of <code>resend</code> is shown. To do this there is a full pipeline of calls that start calling the following method, on <code>MessageToolboxView</code> class, when the user taps that button:
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="step scrolly1" data-step="4" img-src="/resources/images/iOS-connectivity/EC-4.png" figcaption="Sources/UserInterface/Conversation/Content/Cells/Unity/MessageToolboxView.swift">
                                <p>
                                    This call the following method in the <code>ConversationMessageToolboxCell</code>, which is the one in charge of the display of the buttons on the message:
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="step scrolly1" data-step="5" img-src="/resources/images/iOS-connectivity/EC-5.png" figcaption="Sources/UserInterface/Conversation/Content/Cells/ConfigurationMessageCell/ConversationMessageActionController.swift">
                                <p>
                                    As shown, it calls perform method with the action <code>.resend</code>, available in the <code>ConversationMessageActionController</code>, that establishes all the logic that allows to the view perform actions. This is also called via Objective-C:
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="step scrolly1" data-step="6" img-src="/resources/images/iOS-connectivity/EC-6.png" figcaption="Sources/UserInterface/Conversation/Content/Cells/MessageAction.swift">
                                <p>
                                    There are different actions that can be performed. Wire established an enum called <code>MessageAction</code> to list them, and let the app know which types of actions can be done:
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <p>
                                    To check it if the message can be resent there is a variable that stored this property, available in the <code>ZMConversationMessage</code> class:
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="step scrolly1" data-step="8" img-src="/resources/images/iOS-connectivity/EC-8.png" figcaption="Sources/UserInterface/Conversation/Content/Cells/Utility/MessageToolboxView.swift">
                                <p>
                                    In the <code>reloadContent</code> method, in the <code>MessageToolboxView</code> class, some cases are considered depending of what it’s is going to be painted. In the case of failure to send the message this happens: 
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <p>
                                    This method just shows the red <code>resend</code> button and hides the others. The content that can be displayed it’s set by the following enum:
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="step scrolly1" data-step="10" img-src="/resources/images/iOS-connectivity/EC-10.png" figcaption="Sources/UserInterface/Conversation/Content/Cells/Utility/MessageToolboxView.swit">
                                <p>
                                    Finally, the code that establishes all the style of the <code>resend</code> button is the following:
                                </p>
                                <br>
                                <p>
                                    It’s important to clarify that Wire does the same process without taking care of the type of message that failed to send.
