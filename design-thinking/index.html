    <h1>Design Thinking・Wire iOS App Analysis</h1>

    <p>
        Wire states that “Wire is the most secure and user-friendly collaboration solution that helps avoid shadow-IT
        and minimize the risk of cyber attacks”. This is aimed to be the main feature of the app and core business. The
        product is made, primarily, for organizations and its main purpose is to "increase the productivity in your team
        while keeping your information private." With this in mind, it can be affirmed that the segment target of Wire
        is the organizations that have a lot of teams and want to communicate in an easy and safe way. Communicate just
        doesn’t include messages, it also includes files, conference calls or private conversations. For this reason
        “Wire connects colleagues, partners, consultants and customers in one intuitive and secure platform.” In
        summary, the problem that they want to solve is the lack of security and easy ways to communicate between
        members of organizations. For this, they created a multiplatform (Mobile, browser, and desktop) solution where
        organizations can communicate easily and safely. The main characteristics of Wire are:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>End-to-end encrypted.</li>
        <li>Independently audited.</li>
        <li>Multi-device messaging.</li>
        <li>Trusted conversations.</li>
        <li>Forward and backward secrecy. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        In Wire’s page, they include some “Personas”, but they are differentiated from their role in the organization.
        This may be because with this information they want to show how Wire is useful in all roles in an organization
        and why it is a complete solution. Also, for this reason, they don’t include the “casual” or “normal” user that
        is not involved in an organization.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, they have 3 different “packages” besides the normal one. The first one is called “Wire Pro” and
        according to Wire’s page this combines “secure group messaging, voice and video calls, and file sharing, Wire
        Pro is built for organizations that need to protect their documents, and secure their communications across
        teams, and with clients and partners.” For this package, they offer these extra functionalities:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>End-to-end encrypted chats, calls and files.</li>
        <li>Secure guest rooms for external parties.</li>
        <li>Video and audio conference calls with just a click.</li>
        <li>Full administrative controls.</li>
        <li>GDPR-compliant and ISO, CCPA, SOX-ready. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The second one is called “Wire Enterprise” and it’s pretty similar to the first one. The main difference is the
        integrations with differents apps (e.g. calendars, CRM) and premium support. For this package, they offer these
        extra functionalities:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Productive and seamless internal collaboration.</li>
        <li>Protect your data with unrivalled security.</li>
        <li>Steer clear of costly cyber-attacks.</li>
        <li>Secure guest rooms for external parties.</li>
        <li>GDPR-compliant and ISO, CCPA, SOX-ready.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The last one is called “Wire Red” and its main function is to provide a “Secure way to communicate in a crisis”.
        They affirm that “Wire Red is a pre-provisioned secure communication solution to ensure business readiness and
        recovery.”
    </p>

    <p>
        In all the different premium packages Wire provides a free trial. Also, Wire provides a communication whit them
        to know in a better way how Wire works and all the processes to acquire the product.
    </p>

    <p>Wire has a base functionalities like other messaging apps:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Create a chat with a contact.</li>
        <li>Send text messages, voice messages, images, videos, GIFs, location and other attachments like files. </li>
        <li>Audio and video calls. </li>
        <li>Create group chats. </li>
        <li>Mute chats. </li>
        <li>Tag someone else with “@”.</li>
        <li>Tells the user if the message was sent, received and read.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Besides these functionalities Wire has other functionalities that make it different from the other:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Guest rooms: Wire’s secure guest rooms feature extends end-to-end encryption to conversations with external
            parties without requiring them to register, or even download anything.</li>
        <li>Like messages. </li>
        <li>Send draws made in the app. </li>
        <li>Define a time for the message to disappear. </li>
        <li>Send “Pings”. </li>
        <li>Add sound filters and voice changers to voice messages.</li>
        <li>Unique “Fingerprints” in the devices to ensure the sender of the message. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This plus all the security features have made a difference between them and the other messaging apps available.
