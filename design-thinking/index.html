    <h1>Design Thinking・Wire iOS App Analysis</h1>

    <p>
        Wire states that “Wire is the most secure and user-friendly collaboration solution that helps avoid shadow-IT
        and minimize the risk of cyber attacks”. This is aimed to be the main feature of the app and core business. The
        product is made, primarily, for organizations and its main purpose is to "increase the productivity in your team
        while keeping your information private." With this in mind, it can be affirmed that the segment target of Wire
        is the organizations that have a lot of teams and want to communicate in an easy and safe way. Communicate just
        doesn’t include messages, it also includes files, conference calls or private conversations. For this reason
        “Wire connects colleagues, partners, consultants and customers in one intuitive and secure platform.” In
        summary, the problem that they want to solve is the lack of security and easy ways to communicate between
        members of organizations. For this, they created a multiplatform (Mobile, browser, and desktop) solution where
        organizations can communicate easily and safely.

        In Wire’s page, they include some “Personas”, but they are differentiate from their role in the organization.
        This may be because with this information they want to show how Wire is useful in all roles in an organization
        and why it is a complete solution. Also, for this reason they don’t include the “casual” or “normal” user that
        is not involved in an organization.

    <p>
        However, they have 3 different “packages” besides the normal one. The first one is called “Wire Pro” and
        according to Wire’s page this combines “secure group messaging, voice and video calls, and file sharing, Wire
        Pro is built for organizations that need to protect their documents, and secure their communications across
        teams, and with clients and partners.” For this package, they offer these extra functionalities:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>End-to-end encrypted chats, calls and files.</li>
        <li>Secure guest rooms for external parties.</li>
        <li>Video and audio conference calls with just a click.</li>
        <li>Full administrative controls.</li>
        <li>GDPR-compliant and ISO, CCPA, SOX-ready. </li>
    </ul>
